# Material Theme Static

We never changed the colors, NEVER.

Only new functionalities that don't have a material color.

Based on [Material Theme](https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/vscode-material-theme)

# How install
Download material-theme-static-x.vsix from [vsix folder.](https://github.com/Nisgrak/vscode-material-theme-static/tree/master/vsix)

Open a cmd/terminal, go to directory and execute next line

```
code --install-extension *.vsix  # test it
```

Now change your theme and enjoy!
