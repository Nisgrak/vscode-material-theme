# Material Theme for vscode

This is a direct conversion of the excellent Material Theme by [Mattia Astorino](https://github.com/equinusocio), downloaded from the [tmTheme Editor](http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/#!/editor/theme/Material%20Theme) and [converted through Yeoman](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/customization/themes#_adding-a-new-theme) into a vscode extension.
